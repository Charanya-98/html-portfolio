<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Charanya. was born in Chennai and brought up in Bangalore. I completed my schooling across a few cities and earned my undergraduate degree from Seshadripuram First Grade College, Bangalore, followed by my post-graduation from Presidency College, Bangalore.
</p>

<p>I'm currently building my path in software development with a growing skill set in Python, along with working knowledge of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy exploring how things function behind the scenes and also how they visually come together in the browser.

I’m a visual learner who prefers understanding concepts through hands-on experience rather than just reading. I like to take a step-by-step approach, focusing on clarity and real understanding over memorization. I enjoy exploring tools and technologies that simplify tasks, and I pay attention to the details that help me truly grasp how things work.
</p>

<p>Outside of tech, I love simple things—watching the stars, enjoying quiet time, and being close to nature. I like quotes that feel real and meaningful, and sometimes I collect or share them just to keep myself motivated or thoughtful. I don’t talk much, but I observe a lot—and that helps me stay grounded and focused.</p>
